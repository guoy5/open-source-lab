It is important to choose a license because the owners of the code/program have the rights to range the limitation of usage
of their source code by users. By choosing different types of license, the owner set different rights of the use of the source
code. It could avoid a lot of problems such as patent problems for both owners and users.

Becasue when we use a project without a license, we are not certain about the authority we are assigned to this project by owners. Therefore if we do anything beyond the limitation of the authority, the actions would be considered as illegal. To prevent this situation, we have to choosea project with explicit license to work on.

I hold the same opinions with the author. The failure to follow the open systems model is the most important fator that causes the disapperance of the Gopher. In fact, the open source software creates benefits to both users and the developers. The users could sometimes improve the program for developers. It is a win win. However, Gopher did not follow up with the technology of open source.

NET is the development platform used by developers to create apps and services on any device and OS. The opnions by customers could be important to improve the programs. As they offer the customers rights to modication and distribution, it creates a large contribution to the improvment of the program. Also the permission to commercial use is a necessary point because this program is free to use. It makes sure that it has faniancail supports.

I  hold the view that Apache license would be the better choice for a developer. Since it protects the rights of thepatent of the developer for their work. The restriction is necessary for the protection of the property of the developers. At the same time, it also offers users some rights to distribute and modify the program to make improvment for the program of developers.
