c3. In 2002, Jessie Jordan, a student of RPI, improved the search engine of school by the base of microsoft's network file system. He fixed a bug on within the Microsoft file-sharing system and created benefits to both the system and the school search engine. However, the RIAA prosecute him from the exceeding resource sharing of music files due to the develpment of his search engine. He could win at first. But the cost of winning was so huge that he chose to compensate for the prsecution by paying all his earning in that summer to RIAA. This story has alerted me that the use of open source software should be extremely careful. It could not be against the law. And in this case, I believe that is controversial because Jessie's purpose is to improve the engine rather than do someting illegal.
